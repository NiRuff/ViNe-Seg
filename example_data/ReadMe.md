## Example Data

The example data for testing is drawn from the [Neurofinder dataset](http://neurofinder.codeneuro.org/).

### Testing Segmentation Process
To facilitate the testing of the segmentation process, we have uploaded a mean image derived from the first 436 images using ViNe-Seg's microscope mode. 

**Note:** Generating a mean image from a relatively small number of images is not ideal for subsequent segmentation. This limitation is acknowledged, but our primary aim here is to:

- Provide a practical example for users.
- Enable testing of segmentation on a mean image.
- Allow exploration of the functionalities of the microscope mode.
- Offer an opportunity to experiment with trace extraction.

This sample dataset, originating from the Neurofinder's 03.00 dataset, serves as a basic demonstration of ViNe-Seg's capabilities.
